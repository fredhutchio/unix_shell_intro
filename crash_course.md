This tutorial covers

It is not intended to be a replacement for the complete Introduction to Unix course.
but to cover the basic knowledge required to participate in more advanced classes,
and to serve as a reference for participants enrolled in such courses.

- connect to the Fred Hutch on-premise compute resource (`rhino`)
- navigate local and remote directory structures using paths
- work with files and directories using the Unix command line and in-shell text editor (`nano`)
- automate tasks with Unix commands using pipes and shell scripts

## Navigating directories

- paths (relative and absolute)
- shared network drives (accessing)
