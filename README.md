# Introduction to the Unix Shell

## Description

This four class course is designed to introduce attendees to fundamental Unix commands and shell scripting.
Each class includes brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes no prior computing experience. 
At the end of this course, you will be able to use Unix commands to work with and navigate files and directories, 
combine commands using pipes, 
create basic shell scripts,
and search files and their contents.

A solid understanding of these basic principles is required to succeed in our intermediate high performance computing (HPC) courses for both the on-premise clusters and [cloud computing](https://github.com/fredhutchio/hpc_cloud).
Additionally, general Unix skills are a pre-requisite for other intermediate courses,
like [RNAseq analysis](https://fredhutchio.github.io/rnaseq/skills/).
Basic pre-requisites for such courses are described in the [Unix Crash Course](crash_course.md).
